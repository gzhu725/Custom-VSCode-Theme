# Custom-VSCode-Theme
VSCode Custom Theme.

I created my own VSCode Custom Theme (accidentally overriding most, if not all, properties of the Andromeda Theme that I installed with VS Code Extensions). Add the following code to your settings.json file that contains "workbench.colorCustomizations" and change any colors/add other properties if necessary. Documentation for properties can be found [here:](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color).
